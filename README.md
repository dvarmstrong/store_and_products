# store_and_products
# Project using Python OOP with modularization 
This project is an assignment to practice using Python OOP, modularization and association with classes.
We created a store class and a products class to associate .
In the Store class we also added methods to add a product, sell a product, inflate the price of a product and also discount a product for cleareance.
In the Product class we added methods to update the price of a product as well and display the info of a particular Product.
Test.py was created to test and import the two classes and associate the objects and their methods. 
In test.py I have commented out the test I ran to make sure that my methods as well as my objects were associating .
Feel free to modify and play with the code locally.
